# Rutherford Scattering :microscope:
## Simulating Rutherford Scattering using Fortran 90

Completed as part of an undergraduate Computer Science module in a Physics degree. Simulates the result of Rutherfords historical experiment of firing an alpha particle at a gold nucleus, leading to the discovery of the Rutherford model of the atom. Outputs graphical depiction of trajectory of alpha particle and it's scattering from the gold nucleus. 

User can specify:
* Starting velocity of alpha particle.
* Starting displacement of alpha particle from the gold particle.

#### Please compile both **rutherford.f90 and rutherford_sub.f90** before running.
